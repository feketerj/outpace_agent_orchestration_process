# Open Source Highly-Rated Prompt Libraries for Coding with Agents

I've compiled a comprehensive analysis of the top open-source prompt libraries specifically focused on agent-driven coding and application building, organized by tier and relevance.

## Top Tier Recommendations (Production-Grade)

**1. x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools** (15,300+ stars)[^1][^2][^3]
The most valuable resource - contains 6,500+ lines of actual leaked/extracted prompts from production tools like Cursor, Manus, Bolt, Lovable, and v0. These are battle-tested prompts actively used by thousands of developers, not theoretical examples. Recently passed 70k stars across related repositories.[^4]

**2. tallesborges/agentic-system-prompts** (~1,500+ stars, trending)[^1]
Systematically documents prompts from 7 major agentic coding solutions including Claude Code (15 tools), Gemini CLI (11 tools), Cline (12 tools), and Aider. Provides comparative analysis showing how different agents approach the same problems - excellent for understanding architectural trade-offs.

**3. mitsuhiko/agent-prompts** (~500+ stars)[^5]
Created by Armin Ronacher (Flask creator), this collection features production-validated workflow systems for PoC engineering. Includes specialized agents for Software Architecture, Problem Analysis, Task Breakdown, and Implementation in structured pipelines. Author used these prompts to successfully clone Sentry.

**4. dontriskit/awesome-ai-system-prompts** (~3,000+ stars)[^6]
Goes beyond listing prompts to explain the **principles** behind successful agent design. Analyzes v0, same.new, Manus, and Claude with detailed breakdowns of explicit agent loops, modular structures, and operational workflows. Best for understanding the "why" behind design decisions.

**5. BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents** (~2,000+ stars)[^7][^8]
A complete framework combining prompt engineering with software engineering best practices. Features `SystemPromptGenerator`, structured I/O schemas with Pydantic, and CLI tools for component management. Provides type-safe, production-ready agent implementations.

## Specialized Collections

**EliFuzz/awesome-system-prompts** (~1,000+ stars)[^9]
Focused specifically on coding agents including Augment Code, Claude Code, Cursor, Devin AI, Kiro, and Perplexity. Excellent for comparing commercial coding agent approaches.

**wild-card-ai/agents-json** (~400+ stars)[^10]
Standardized JSON schemas for agent-to-agent communication, handoff contracts, and message passing. Critical for multi-agent orchestration systems.

## Educational Foundation

**dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide** (39,900+ stars)[^11]
The most comprehensive educational resource covering zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, self-consistency, and advanced techniques with research papers and Jupyter notebooks. Essential baseline knowledge before diving into agent-specific patterns.

## Selection Guide by Use Case

**Need production prompts immediately?**
→ x1xhlol/system-prompts (15.3k) or tallesborges/agentic-system-prompts

**Want to understand agent design principles?**
→ dontriskit/awesome-ai-system-prompts or dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide

**Building multi-agent orchestration?**
→ mitsuhiko/agent-prompts (workflows) or wild-card-ai/agents-json (protocols)

**Need a complete framework?**
→ BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents

## Key Production Trends (2024-2025)

Research reveals several critical patterns from these libraries:[^6][^5][^1]

- **Explicit operational loops** replacing implicit behavior
- **Modular prompt structures** for maintainability and scaling
- **Tool specifications** as important as prompts themselves
- **Reflection patterns** (thinking tags) becoming standard[^12]
- **Structured I/O schemas** for deterministic agent behavior
- **Quality gates** with >95% confidence thresholds

The most actively maintained repositories are x1xhlol/system-prompts (weekly updates), tallesborges/agentic-system-prompts (monthly), and BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents (active framework development). All provide production-grade patterns aligned with your orchestration philosophy emphasizing safety, modularity, and deterministic execution.
