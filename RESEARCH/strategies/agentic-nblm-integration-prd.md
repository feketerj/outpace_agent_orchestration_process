# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary
The purpose of this PRD is to define the requirements for integrating upcoming outputs from the NBLM (Next Baseline Language Model) into the OutPace Agent Orchestration Process. The integration will enable orchestrated, deterministic agent workflows that consume, analyze, and operationalize NBLM outputs while honoring user maxims of "slow, safe, correct" execution. The deliverable is a modular capability that converts NBLM artifacts into actionable plans, prompts, and execution tasks across the existing multi-agent ecosystem.

---

## 2. Background & Context
- **User philosophy:** Documented in `_REFERENCE/user_technical_execution_doc.md`; emphasizes modular builds, atomic tasking, 95%+ confidence thresholds, and machine-readable handoffs.
- **Current assets:** Research on LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI in `RESEARCH/frameworks/`; evergreen prompt libraries in `PROMPTS/`; orchestration best practices captured in `agent-orchestration-best-practices.md`.
- **Business objective:** Scale GovCon and enterprise AI services with repeatable, auditable agent-driven builds; reduce manual effort; improve time-to-value for client-specific deliverables.
- **Trigger event:** Imminent availability of NBLM outputs (structured/unstructured) requiring ingestion, evaluation, and deployment inside the orchestrated agent workflow.

---

## 3. Problem Statement
Without a structured integration layer, NBLM outputs risk remaining siloed assets that cannot be reliably transformed into execution-ready tasks. Manual interpretation increases error rates, slows delivery, and violates the user's preference for agent-led execution with clear guardrails.

---

## 4. Goals & Non-Goals
- **Goals**
  - G1: Seamlessly ingest NBLM outputs and classify them for downstream agent consumption.
  - G2: Generate orchestration-ready artifacts (PRDs, WBS, prompts, validation checklists) aligned with existing repository standards.
  - G3: Maintain deterministic, auditable workflows with machine-readable handoffs for every transformation step.
  - G4: Provide visibility into confidence levels, validation status, and ownership for each agent-produced artifact.
- **Non-Goals**
  - NG1: Training or fine-tuning the NBLM model.
  - NG2: Building custom UI front-ends (CLI/automation only in this phase).
  - NG3: Replacing existing prompt libraries; instead, extend and map them to NBLM output types.

---

## 5. Target Users & Personas
- **Primary User:** Rob Fekete (Strategist/Orchestrator) — drives planning, reviews agent outputs, sets confidence gates.
- **Secondary Users:**
  - Execution agents (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Nous instances) configured via existing prompts.
  - QC/Validation agents ensuring compliance with 95% confidence threshold.
  - Future human collaborators who rely on machine-readable documentation to resume sessions.

---

## 6. Key Assumptions
- NBLM provides exportable artifacts (JSON, Markdown, or text) representing research, code, requirements, or project assets.
- Access to NBLM outputs can be automated (API, filesystem, or manual drop) and scheduled.
- Existing agent prompts remain compatible; only mappings and orchestration layers need updates.
- Security posture remains client-side, private repositories with controlled secrets management.

---

## 7. Functional Requirements
1. **Ingestion & Normalization**
   - F1.1: Detect new NBLM output packages and classify content type (strategy, requirements, code snippet, research, data).
   - F1.2: Convert ingested artifacts into standardized schemas (JSON preferred) with metadata (source id, timestamp, confidence, sensitivity tags).
   - F1.3: Store normalized artifacts inside a dedicated workspace directory (e.g., `NBLM_OUTPUTS/`) with session versioning.

2. **Analysis & Routing**
   - F2.1: Map artifact types to agent teams (strategist, research, execution, QC) using decision rules defined in `PROMPTS/evergreen-app-prompts.json`.
   - F2.2: Generate meta-prompts tailored to the designated agent model, referencing relevant user context and repository assets.
   - F2.3: Produce orchestration brief per artifact, capturing objectives, dependencies, and required outputs.

3. **Plan & PRD Generation**
   - F3.1: Automatically draft project PRDs (including this template) from NBLM research summaries.
   - F3.2: Create super-atomic task lists and WBS aligned with context window constraints per executing agent.
   - F3.3: Output machine-readable handoff packets containing prompts, expected deliverables, validation criteria, and rollback procedures.

4. **Validation & Confidence Tracking**
   - F4.1: Attach confidence scores to each generated artifact and agent assignment.
   - F4.2: Provide QC agent with structured checklists referencing `agent-orchestration-best-practices.md` validation gates.
   - F4.3: Log validation outcomes and feedback for retrospective learning (append to `NOTES/perplexity-research-notes.txt` or dedicated log).

5. **Continuity & Reporting**
   - F5.1: Update continuity documentation (session summaries, status dashboards) after every orchestration cycle.
   - F5.2: Surface change history, pending actions, and blocking issues to strategist agents.
   - F5.3: Package final outputs for user consumption with a clear binary status ("ready / not ready").

---

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** Maintain secrets in `_REFERENCE/project_api_keys.md` (local only); ensure NBLM data inherits repository privacy posture.
- **Reliability:** 99% success rate for ingestion jobs; automated alerts for failures or malformed payloads.
- **Observability:** Logging for each pipeline stage with timestamps, agent assignments, and confidence levels.
- **Extensibility:** Schema-first design enabling additional models or downstream tools without redesign.
- **Performance:** End-to-end processing (ingest → packaged handoff) under 5 minutes for standard artifact bundles (<5 MB).
- **Compliance:** Preserve audit trails to satisfy GovCon clients and internal QA expectations.

---

## 9. Success Metrics & KPIs
- **Automation Coverage:** ≥80% of NBLM artifacts processed without manual intervention.
- **Cycle Time Reduction:** ≥40% reduction in time from receipt of NBLM output to agent-ready plan.
- **Validation Pass Rate:** ≥95% of generated artifacts pass QC on first attempt.
- **Continuity Readiness:** Ability for fresh agent team to resume project within 15 minutes using generated documentation.
- **User Satisfaction:** Qualitative feedback from strategist (Rob) indicating improved clarity and reduced rework.

---

## 10. Proposed Architecture & Workflow
1. **Ingestion Layer** (PowerShell or Python script) monitors designated NBLM export location.
2. **Classification Engine** leverages pattern matching and metadata tags to categorize artifacts.
3. **Normalization Pipeline** converts inputs into repository-standard JSON/Markdown templates.
4. **Orchestration Planner** references `PROMPTS/evergreen-app-prompts.json` to assign agent teams and produce meta-prompts.
5. **Execution Agents** process assigned tasks, generating code, documentation, or analysis.
6. **QC Agents** validate outputs against checklists; failures loop back with remediation prompts.
7. **Continuity Logger** updates session status, change logs, and user-facing briefs.

---

## 13. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| NBLM outputs lack structure | High | Medium | Implement heuristic fallback; request format update from NBLM team |
| Context window overflow for large artifacts | Medium | High | Atomic chunking, streaming prompts, use summarization agents |
| Token/secrets leakage | High | Low | Maintain `.gitignore`, rotate tokens post-testing |
| Agent misalignment with new artifact types | Medium | Medium | Iterative prompt tuning; include validation gating |
| User bandwidth for oversight | Medium | Medium | Provide concise executive briefs; enable asynchronous review |

---

## 14. Open Questions
1. What exact formats and metadata will NBLM outputs include?
2. Will NBLM provide confidence scores or do we derive them post-ingestion?
3. Are there regulatory or classification constraints on NBLM data that exceed current privacy posture?
4. Do we need real-time ingestion or is batch processing sufficient?
5. Which downstream systems (e.g., MCP servers, automation platforms) require immediate integration?
